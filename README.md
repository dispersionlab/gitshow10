### Dependencies:
Uses Circuit Music Labs Petra external (included in repo)
https://github.com/CircuitMusicLabs/petra
Uses Max 8 MC objects

### Score:
Open tumble.maxpat. Turn on the audio and click the toggle to enable. A drum synthesizer and granular synth are controlled by generative sequencing events. Use the "Time" controls to create a wide, sparse texture. Play with the Time sliders to move between sparseness and extreme density.  Turn down the granular synth and try to create a drone with only the drum module. Turn down the drum and try to create something percussive with the granular module. Bring both layers back in. Use the button next to the "Grain" label to replace the sound file.
