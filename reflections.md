The most immediately noticeable  feature of the piece is the stereo mixing, with each side featuring its own alternating buzz/bass sound. Theses sound change in speed over time, and are occasionally punctuated by seemingly arrhythmic chirps. The chirps develop a more coherent rhythm at 0:52. IT devolves into sudden buzzing at 1:09. The plucking continues, but loses its rhythm.

More traditionally musical sounds, similar to chirping or plucking, rather than the buzzing heard previously in the piece, begin around 1:06. At the same time, the mixing of the piece beings to fluctuate.

The score, while cryptic, does provide some explanation, as flipping the SWITCHES on the MODULES is an effective way to vary the synthesizer's sound in VCV. However, the last line remains too vague to be of any substantial use.


For this iteration of the piece, edits were made to the values of the resonator modules at the bottom of the scene, giving the sounds they produced a less percussive, more melodic sound. It was preformed by slowly manipulating the frequency nobs of the LFO-1 and LFO-2  modules in the top left corner.
