The most immediately noticeable  feature of the piece is the stereo mixing, with each side featuring its own alternating buzz/bass sound. Theses sound change in speed over time, and are occasionally punctuated by seemingly arrhythmic chirps. The chirps develop a more coherent rhythm at 0:52. IT devolves into sudden buzzing at 1:09. The plucking continues, but loses its rhythm.

More traditionally musical sounds, similar to chirping or plucking, rather than the buzzing heard previously in the piece, begin around 1:06. At the same time, the mixing of the piece beings to fluctuate.

The score, while cryptic, does provide some explanation, as flipping the SWITCHES on the MODULES is an effective way to vary the synthesizer's sound in VCV. However, the last line remains too vague to be of any substantial use.

For this iteration of the piece, the drum synthesizers were replaced with a VCO-1 module. The inputs and outputs into the other modules were reorganized to reflect this change, and finalized after some experimentation. It was preformed by slowly manipulating the frequency nobs of the LFO-1, VCO-1 modules, as well as toggling the value of the two switches on the VCO-1 module.
