## First Thoughts

The track begins with a slightly low bassline that quickly transforms with additional layers.  These layers, like the catalyst bassline before it, seem expected, slightly distorted at times, but well within recognizable patterns.  One minute in (~60s) and chaotic sounds appear, although in an orderly fashion (such as their time scale), but seemingly more random in their play.
