## First Thoughts

The track begins with a slightly low bassline that quickly transforms with additional layers.  These layers, like the catalyst bassline before it, seem expected, slightly distorted at times, but well within recognizable patterns.  One minute in (~60s) and chaotic sounds appear, although in an orderly fashion (such as their time scale), but seemingly more random in their play.

As shown in the image above, the recording was achieved with a 17 module setup that looks pretty clean and organized.  Patching cable amount seems large yet really easy to follow.  Notable modules for me at first glance was the Quantizer. Seeing how that works in this rack makes me want to work with this module in my first edit.
