From the start this is going to be different from the previous scores that I have worked with. The first one that I had was only 3 lines, but they formed a structure almost like a haiku. This being basically a single line of instruction is interesting, and leaves a lot of freedom. Basically as much freedom as you can get from these scores.

Previously I had done notes at each point in the score that matched with a point in the music. In this instance I will be writing them out, since everything would just be under that single instruction anyway.
