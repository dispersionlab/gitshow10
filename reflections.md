The whole composition is composed of the five types of sounds above. The sound of Muyu basically remains stable, and the sharp rustling sound will trigger the transition at a specific time. The deep drum sound in the background will increase in speed. After reaching a certain speed, a sharp bell sound will be triggered. Sharp bells will be triggered, in turn, on the left and right channels.

The big bell sound is triggered at 0:54, and the echo of this bell sound will last a long time (15 seconds). Acceleration also makes the rustling noise more uncontrollable and noisy. After all the sounds suddenly stopped at the apex, only the sound of the wooden fish gradually went away at the end.

Except for the adjustment of the resonator and rampage, the rest of the parts are basically redone. By connecting the segment generator to the rampage to control the trigger frequency of the sound, the large bell sound is directly triggered by LFO-1. The segment generator will make the tempo faster and faster (this is also the reason for the score; you don’t need to do any operation), reach the peak, return to the starting point, and start again.
