>整个乐曲由上述的5种声音构成，木鱼的声音基本维持稳定，在特定的时候会触发转变的尖锐的沙沙声。背景中低沉的鼓声会越来越快，到达一定速度后会触发sharp bells sound，sharp bells会在左声道和右声道轮流触发。在0:54的时候触发Big bell sound，这个钟声的回音会持续很久（15秒）。加速同时会使沙沙声变得更加不可控，更嘈杂。在所有声音到达顶点后突然停止，只剩下木鱼声渐渐远去，作为结尾。

The whole composition is composed of the above five kinds of sounds. The sound of Muyu basically remains stable, and the sharp rustling sound will trigger the transition at a specific time. The deep drum sound in the background will become faster and faster. After reaching a certain speed, sharp bells sound will be triggered. Sharp bells will be triggered in turn on the left and right channels.

The Big bell sound is triggered at 0:54, and the echo of this bell sound will last a long time (15 seconds). Acceleration also makes the rustling noise more uncontrollable and noisy. After all the sounds suddenly stopped at the apex, only the sound of the wooden fish gradually went away as the end.

>除了对resonator和rampage进行了调整，剩下的部分基本都进行重做。通过连接segment generator到rampage去控制声音的触发频率，大钟声是直接由LFO-1触发的。segement generator会使节奏越来越快（这也是在score中，你几乎不用做任何操作的原因），达到顶点后回到起点再次重来。

Except for the adjustment of the resonator and rampage, the rest of the parts are basically redone. By connecting the segment generator to the rampage to control the trigger frequency of the sound, the large bell sound is directly triggered by LFO-1. The segement generator will make the tempo faster and faster (this is also the reason in the score, you don't need to do any operation), reach the peak, return to the starting point and start again.
