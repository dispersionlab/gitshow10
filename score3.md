### module3 description
module3.js is a gate sequencer, which takes as its only input a signal. It compares the input 	signal amplitude against 6 logical conditions, and sends a gate out of one of the 6 outputs. 

- Inputs: IN1
- Outputs: OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4, OUT5, OUT6


In the recording and provided patch, LFO-2's output signal is controlling the progression of the sequencer. The LFO-1 modulates the waveshape of the LFO-2, thereby altering the pattern of the sequencer. The outputs of module3 are both striking the resonators as well as triggering function outputs of the rampage.
